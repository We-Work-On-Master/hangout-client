**Development Process**

Verison 1:

The MVP has a single user creating events  that belong to them and can be viewed by them alone.

After our initial planning meeting where we outlined how we wanted to function as a group/distribute roles and assignment, we created the forms for the desired functions and the CRUD operations.

Events for the submit actions were created and linked to the API calls

Decided that we would do a Many-to-Many between events and users.

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**

- We did not allow users to send out messages to all RSVPd users.
- 3rd party APi would like to be implemented
