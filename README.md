**Hangout Application  Description**

It's broken down by event: location, name, date.

The front end is hosted on [github pages](https://we-work-on-master.github.io/hangout-client/), and the backend API is hosted on [heroku](https://mysterious-island-33488.herokuapp.com/). —> need to make sure these are both the right links at the end of the project

**Development Process**

Verison 1:

The MVP has a single user creating events  that belong to them and can be viewed by them alone.

After our initial planning meeting where we outlined how we wanted to function as a group/distribute roles and assignment, we created the forms for the desired functions and the CRUD operations.

Events for the submit actions were created and linked to the API calls

Decided that we would do a Many-to-Many between events and users.

**Unsolved Issues & Future Goals**

- Having a small messaging issue - but will fix.
- SCSS would be the next thing I need to work on
- In the future I'd love to make the user be able to search for a building via a search bar using the parameters of: Building Address/Location, Sq Ft, Built Date, and Price
- I'd also love to have an option to set a particular building with a class i.e. Mixed Use, Retail, Office, Industrial etc.
